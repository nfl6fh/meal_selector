# meal_selector

A simple meal selector for the command line.

When given calories and macros as input, it will return a list of meals that fit those macros. This is currently a work in progress, and is not yet complete. It will begin as a command line tool and eventually be turned into a web app. When I do turn this into a web app, I will also connect it to a database of meals instead of having the db within the repo.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo. You can do this by running `git clone https://github.com/nfl6fh/meal_selector.git` in the directory you want to clone the repo into.
2. Make sure all requirements are installed. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the repo.
3. Run `python meal_selector.py` in the root directory of the repo and follow the command line prompts.
